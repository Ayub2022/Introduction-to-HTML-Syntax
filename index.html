<h1>My first HTML page</h1>

<p>Hi <img src="./Images/hey-you-emoji.png" alt="hey" width="50" height="40">, my name is <b>Ayub</b> and I'm learning HTML.</p>
<p>I would describe myself as being very introverted and quiet. I’m also very independent. I really don’t like working with partners, unless they’re my friends or I feel comfortable around them. But I generally like to do things on my own. I don’t really know if I’ve accomplished all that much in life. I feel like graduating from Azubi Africa front-end developer course would be one of my accomplishment.</p>

<h2>My Motivation</h2>

<p> <em>HTML is the basis for learning other languages</em>. HTML is just one of those languages you have to get through in order to open your doors to new and exciting directions such as CSS.</p>
<p>It's the cornerstone of the web if you are indeed interested in learning <u>Web Development</u>, and you'll need to master it to be successful. </p>
